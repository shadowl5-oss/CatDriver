Abstract
We present a novel theoretical framework for interpreting quantum mechanical phenomena, termed the "Nietzsche's Cat Principle." This principle extends QBism (Quantum Bayesianism) by incorporating a fundamental "persistence bias" that suggests quantum systems exhibit a statistical tendency to maintain states of continued existence. Our 8-state quantum formulation challenges traditional interpretations of quantum superposition while offering potential explanations for the apparent stability of macroscopic objects despite quantum indeterminacy at microscopic levels.


1. Theoretical Foundation
The Nietzsche's Cat Principle draws inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the "will to power" by postulating that fundamental particles demonstrate a statistical "will to persist" in their state of being. This framework employs an 8-digit numerical system (using only digits 1-8) to represent quantum states, with odd digits (1,3,5,7) representing "alive" or "persistence" states and even digits (2,4,6,8) representing "dead" or "cessation" states.

This principle recontextualizes the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. In our formulation, the cat exists in superposition (simultaneously alive and dead until observed), but with an intrinsic bias toward alive states due to the persistence principle. This bias manifests mathematically as a slight statistical deviation from the perfect 50/50 probability distribution expected in traditional quantum mechanical interpretations.
2. Mathematical Formulation
In standard quantum mechanics, a two-state system is represented by the state vector:

|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where |α|² + |β|² = 1

The Nietzsche's Cat Principle modifies this by introducing a persistence parameter p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) that biases probability toward "alive" states:

|ψNC⟩ = α'|0⟩ + β'|1⟩

Where α' and β' are modified amplitudes that incorporate the persistence bias:

|β'|² = |β|² + p(|α|² - |β|²)/2 when |β|² < 0.5 |α'|² = 1 - |β'|²

In our expanded 8-state system, we extend this bias to favor states 1, 3, 5, and 7 over states 2, 4, 6, and 8, maintaining normalization requirements.
3. Experimental Methodology
Our computational experiments simulate quantum systems under various conditions to test the statistical predictions of the Nietzsche's Cat Principle. The methodology includes:

Single quantum system simulations with variable persistence strength (0.0-1.0)
Batch trials (n=10,000+) comparing traditional quantum mechanics to our modified theory
Statistical analysis of deviation from expected probability distributions
Implementation of custom quantum gates that encode the persistence principle

Our simulator employs matrix operations with complex number calculations to accurately model quantum evolution according to both standard quantum mechanics and our modified framework.
4. Preliminary Results
Initial computational experiments show measurable statistical deviations from standard quantum mechanical predictions when the persistence parameter is applied. Key findings include:

Statistical bias toward "alive" states that increases proportionally with persistence strength
Emergence of patterns consistent with quantum decoherence but with systematic deviation favoring persistent states
Consistency with macroscopic observations while maintaining quantum principles at microscopic levels

Of particular note is that when p = 0, our results converge precisely with standard quantum mechanical predictions, demonstrating that our theory represents a parametric extension rather than a contradiction of established quantum theory.
5. Theoretical Implications
The Nietzsche's Cat Principle offers several intriguing theoretical implications:

Measurement Problem: Provides a new perspective on the collapse of the wave function by suggesting an inherent tendency in matter toward certain states
Quantum-Classical Transition: Offers a potential mechanism for how quantum indeterminacy at microscopic scales gives way to apparent determinism at macroscopic scales
Philosophy of QBism: Extends QBism by incorporating an agent-independent characteristic (persistence) while maintaining its participatory framework
Many-Worlds Interpretation: Suggests that in a many-worlds scenario, branches representing continued existence may have greater statistical weight
6. Empirical Testability
While our computational experiments provide initial support, the Nietzsche's Cat Principle generates several empirically testable predictions:

Statistically significant deviations from standard quantum probability distributions in carefully designed interference experiments
Persistence effects that scale with system complexity in a predictable manner
Measurable bias in quantum random number generators when generating sequences with semantic association to "existence" vs. "non-existence" states
7. Conclusion
The Nietzsche's Cat Principle represents a novel theoretical framework that extends quantum interpretations by incorporating a fundamental persistence bias. While speculative, our computational results suggest this approach merits further investigation through rigorous experimental testing. If validated, this principle could contribute to resolving longstanding questions about the relationship between quantum indeterminacy and the apparent stability of the macroscopic world.
